# k nearest neighbour tutorial for codeclan

During this short data science tutorial students will use a historical dataset of baseball players in the 80â€™s to predict their salaries. We will consider a few measures of player experience and performance to predict the salary that they earn. We will use the statistical programming language R and to go from data to model to evaluation and inference, a whistle stop tour of the data science journey.

We will cover:
-       R objects, and exploring a dataset e.g. plotting
-       Data handling and transforming numeric variables
-       The K nearest neighbour regression approach
-       Evaluating model performance and behaviour
